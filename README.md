# Urinary Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer

## Task
The key features are four urinary biomarkers: creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, and TFF1.

Creatinine is a protein that is often used as an indicator of kidney function.

YVLE1 is lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, a protein that may play a role in tumor metastasis.

REG1B is a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration.

TFF1 is trefoil factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract.

Age and sex, both included in the dataset, may also play a role in who gets pancreatic cancer. The dataset includes a few other biomarkers as well, but these were not measured in all patients (they were collected partly to measure how various blood biomarkers compared to urine biomarkers).

### Prediction task
The goal in this dataset is predicting diagnosis, and more specifically, differentiating between 3 (pancreatic cancer) versus 2 (non-cancerous pancreas condition) and 1 (healthy). The dataset includes information on stage of pancreatic cancer, and diagnosis for non-cancerous patients.
